# SLUGGER: Lossless Hierarchical Summarization of Massive Graphs
Source code for the paper [SLUGGER: Lossless Hierarchical Summarization of Massive Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01060), Kyuhan Lee*, Jihoon Ko*, and Kijung Shin, ICDE 2022.

**SLUGGER** (**S**calable **L**ossless S**u**mmarization of **G**raphs with Hi**er**archy) is a lossless hierarchical graph summarization algorithm that has the following superiorities:
* *Effective*: yielding up to 29.6% more concise summaries than its state-of-the-art competitors.
* *Fast*: summarizing a graph with 0.8 billion edges in a few hours.
* *Scalable*: scaling linear with the number of edges in the input graph.
