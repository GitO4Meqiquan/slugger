 =================================================================================

 SLUGGER is a lossless hierarchical graph summarization algorithm that has the following superiorities:
 - Effective: yielding up to 29.6% more concise summaries than its state-of-the-art competitors.
 - Fast: summarizing a graph with 0.8 billion edges in a few hours.
 - Scalable: scaling linear with the number of edges in the input graph.
